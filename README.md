# Pomodoro js

Pomodoro js is a task management app based on the task and break timers which lets you do work efficiently while keeping track of the time. This App is based on the previous version of it which I developed using react js and node js.

**Url of previous version:**

- https://github.com/gauravyadav-wd/Pomodoro

## Objectives

- Conversion of JSX to html.
- Understanding css modules from react and using those modules in this project to achieve the exact styling.
- Conversion of react based functionality to javascript based functionality.
- Working without state changes.

## Getting Started

**Open in VSCode:**
Open the project in VSCode.

**Run Server:**
Run the server by going in the directory 'server' and run the following commands.

- npm install
- npm start

**Run Client:**
Run the client by going in the directory 'client/homepage' and open the file 'index.html' while the server is running.

**User Interactions:**

- Add a new Task Group.
- View Completed, Incomplete and To be done task groups.
- Initiate a timer for a task group.
- Play Guess My Number game on break timer.
- Switch Dark/Light Mode

## Considerations

App is not fully functional and ready to use. Right now we are mimicing the login process. Since the tasks are stored in the local storage, we are not storing information differently for each user.
